# -Acoustic-Amplifier-System-for-Underwater-Submarine-Communication


- Designed a low-noise acoustic preamplifier using JFE150 and OPA202, optimized for high-sensitivity underwater signaldetection in submarine communication systems.
â€“ Made a power amplifier stage with PCB design for efficient underwater acoustic transmission, enabling long-range, low frequency data transfer in harsh deep-sea environments.
